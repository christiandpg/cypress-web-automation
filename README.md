# Cypress Web & API tests

## Overview

This project contains automated tests for the DuckDuckGo search functionality using Cypress. The tests validate the search results and ensure the application behaves as expected when interacting with the UI elements.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Tests the search capability of DuckDuckGo and verifies that results contain the expected search term.
- **Region Filtering**: Validates the region filter dropdown and checks that there are sufficient options available.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (can be installed via npm)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/christiandpg/cypress-web-automation.git
   cd cypress-web-automation

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install

3. Set up your environment variable for the search string. You can do this by creating a .env file or setting it directly in your shell:

    ```
    export searchString="simpsons"

## Running the Tests

To open the Cypress Test Runner, use the following command:


    npx cypress open

This will launch the Cypress GUI where you can run your tests interactively.

To run tests headlessly in the terminal, use:

    ```
    npx cypress run

## Test Structure

The tests are organized in the `cypress/e2e` directory. Each test suite is defined in a separate file for better organization and maintainability.

### Example Test Cases
1. DuckDuckGo Search Test
- Verifies that searching for a term returns results containing that term.
- Checks that there are more than 10 regions available in the dropdown filter.

## Custom Commands

Custom commands are defined in `cypress/support/commands.js`. This allows for reusable API requests and simplifies test code.
